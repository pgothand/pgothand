- ğŸŒ± Although I try to be a comprehensive programmer, my main specialization is Python. 
- ğŸŒ± I believe that only a combination of professional code and modern design can give stunning effects. 
- ğŸŒ± Programming is not only my job, it is also my passion. 
- ğŸŒ± To develop, I set myself new challenges all the time. 
- ğŸŒ± I consider myself inventive and ambitious, hence I am constantly looking for original solutions. 
- ğŸŒ± Aside from programming I like traveling, biking and cricket (as a player, not a fan). Some also say that I am good at drawing.
